## There Are No Strings on Me (100pts)

### Description: 

>We've got this program that's supposed to check a password, and we're not quite sure how it works. Could you take a look at it and see about finding the password it's looking for?

###  Procedure:
Lets check the strings in it 

```
root@kali~$ strings strings
```

I personally use Cyberchef to check the strings in it.

Eventually i got the flag:)
